# Tampere electric buses

## Description

This document describes how measurements from electric buses originally stored
in Wapice IoT-Ticket will be stored to FIWARE.

## Data Model

The data model is based on the official FIWARE
[Vehicle data model](https://fiware-datamodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Transportation/Vehicle/Vehicle/doc/spec/index.html)
with some custom attributes added. First attributes used fromt he official model
with original descriptions are listed here with some additional notes. Then
attributes added to the model are described.

### Vehicle attributes
